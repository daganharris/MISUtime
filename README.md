**Converts between Earth ISO and MISU timestamp formats in the terminal. Provides helpful formatting error messages.**
# Features
- Takes in an Earth ISO Timestamp or a MISU Timestamp and spits out the other format.
- Has a Help menu with all currently available commands.
- Will tell you how to format correctly if you make a mistake.
# MISU What?
MISU Time is a fictional time system I devised whe worldbuilding for the book I am planning to write. I know, yawn.

It divides the day into 10 hours, with 100 minutes in an hour and 100 seconds in a minute. There are 10 days in a week, 10 weeks in a month and 10 months in a year. Thats a 1000 day year, not a 365 day one.
# Future Ideas
- [ ] Make it accept a timestamp and convert automatically without modes.
- [ ] Add command arguments `--version` and `-v` that returns the version only.
- [ ] Add support for durations/ages.
# Disclaimer
I started this in C# becuase of my familiarity of the language, however for the sake of the executable's size and the efficiency, I am thinking of switching to Go or Rust.
